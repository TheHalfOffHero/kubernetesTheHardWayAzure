# Kubernetes The Hard Way Azure

This project is an attempt to implement kubernetes the hard way using terraform and ansible so I can spin up vms. Do the setup and then bring them down. Essentially giving us a full cluster on vms for a sandbox.

follows guidance from the [Kubernetes the hard way repo](https://github.com/ivanfioravanti/kubernetes-the-hard-way-on-azure/blob/master/docs/02-client-tools.md)
